My Datafornix project description

I have built many amazing applications. One of the amazing applications I have built is a Datafornix application. 
The project is a B2B application whose services can be used by Banks and Financial Organisations for storing their customer's documents.
In this Datafornix project, I have created several restful APIs for identity verification like Video liveliness check API, 
Selfie check API, GeoAddressCheck API, AssetProcess API, Image comparison API, etc.

In this Datafornix project, I have used Google Vision API to extract text from the images. 
I have also used RSA and AES encryption and decryption process to make the API secure.
I have created APIs for the mobile end so that the user can upload various assets like ID card, Driving license, Passport, Gas Bill, etc.
